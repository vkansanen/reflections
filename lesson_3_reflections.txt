1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 
 	If you work with a team or if you need to work on multiple computers.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You don't want to risk having your work overwritten by older work or by someone elses work.
