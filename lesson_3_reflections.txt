1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 
 	If you work with a team or if you need to work on multiple computers.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You don't want to risk having your work overwritten by older work or by someone elses work.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	I would use fork when basing work off someone else's repository but not having permission or relation with the original repository. I would clone when I want to keep the repository in its current state but continue to work on it, or copy someone else's repository. I would create a branch when the master is in a good individual state but I want to try something or build new things on it without disturbing it, for example if it were a "production" version of the code.
