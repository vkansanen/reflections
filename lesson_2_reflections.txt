1. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

		The staging area is where you start your project. It gives you more leeway to experiment and build without exposure from external forces. That's right, forces.


2. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

		You can use diff to compare the working files and repository file to remain consistent.
